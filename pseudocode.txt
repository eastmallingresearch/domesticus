Decide on part location (this will determine whether to worry about inframe changes)

If coding- check if there are site and what frame they are in.

Look for synonymous changes etc

When a point mutation has been decided upon this defines (around a couple of bp window) 
the 3' end of the primer (before the 10bp overhang has been added (how are these decided- 
I suspect they can be anything but the ones needed for the actual construct to go into
the vector)

Design the primers 4 for each mutation 1F 1R 2F 2R

Strategy for removing internal type IIS recognition sequences. Removal of a BsaI site in 
a fragment of interest is done by amplifying two fragments with primers pr1 and 2 and 
primers pr3 and 4. Primers pr2 and pr3 span the BsaI recognition site and introduce a 
single nucleotide mismatch (indicated by an arrow). As all primers have BpiI recognition 
sites in their 5' extensions, the PCR fragments are cloned with a BpiI-based Golden Gate
cloning reaction in the appropriate level 0 destination vector.

#GOLDENBRAID
Once you have all your patches the domestication reaction should be performed as follows:
40 ng of each patch
75 ng of pUPD
5-10u BsmBI
3u T4 Ligase
1 microlitre Ligase Buffer

Final volume: 10 microlitres

We use Promega T4 DNA ligase(M180B) and fermentas BsmBI/Esp3I (ER0451). 
We haven't tried other enzymes suppliers but they will problably work as well.


Set your reaction in a thermocycler: 25 cycles x (37C 2', 16C 5').
One microlitre of the reaction is enough to be transform E.coli 
electrocompetent cells. Positive clones are selected in Ampicillin (50 microgram ml-1),
 IPTG (0.5mM) and Xgal (40 microgram ml-1) plates. You will distinguish between colonies 
 carrying intact vectors (blue) and those transformed with your construction (white).
